This project is based on JPetStore 6 which created by offical mybatis team. The origin JPetStore 6 is built on MyBatis 3, Spring 3 and Stripes. I changed it to Spring MVC 3 instead of Stripes because I prefer Spring MVC and I know nothing about Stripes!
See the origin project demo: http://www.mybatis.org/spring/sample.html
